If you look at the "test" files, they show examples of JUnit tests that I produced in order to test the code I wrote. Interpreting user's needs is one of the most important steps when beginning a project. I want to make sure I understand every need from the client and end-user so the product will be the best it can be. Being extremely thorough is something I attempt when gathering information on a project, as well as asking all appropriate questions regarding requirements. Designing software can be challenging when starting from scratch, but it is important to take it step-by-step. I also like to test as I write code, as it will help reduce errors and create efficiency. JUnit tests are a great example, as you can create any test you would like, and even see how much of the project has been tested via JUnit using a coverage test. This ensures that the project is tested and functioning correctly, which is vital to a successful project.
